**To Do:**   

Description | Status| Deliverable
------- |:-----------: | :-----:
Research and take notes on word2vec/fasttext/glove/elmo/bert | :large_orange_diamond: | Re
Run some experiments and word math comparing baseBERT and religioBERT|:large_orange_diamond:|Ml
ReligioBERT Score a religious text and serialize output to be used in scoring new user input|:large_orange_diamond:|Ml
Create script to load in user input, pre-process, get religioBERT embedding, and find related passage from scored and serialized religious text|:large_orange_diamond:|Ml
Productionalize your best performing ML model. Expose the ML model as a REST service|:large_orange_diamond:|Rt
Go back and include instructions for how to set everything up and recreate everything |:large_orange_diamond:| Cb
Make sure docstrings/comments/logging is plentiful and thorough|:x:| Cb
Survey relevant academic literature, write a one-page summary of findings. Include a various approaches|:large_orange_diamond:|Rt
Run experiments and record results. Write a one-to-two page description of 1) the method and 2) the results of your experiments, justifying why you chose your final model to deploy|:large_orange_diamond:|Rt
Describe your work as a short paper (maximum of 4 pages, including citations)|:large_orange_diamond:|Rt
Prepare a 3-minute powerpoint presentation describing your work|:large_orange_diamond:|Rt

**Completed:**
Description | Status| Deliverable
------- |:-----------: | :-----:
